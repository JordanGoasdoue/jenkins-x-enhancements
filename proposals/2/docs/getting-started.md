## Getting started

Currently you will need a custom build of `jx` from this [Pull Request](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/pull/6664).

Also you will need to install [helmfile](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile) 

###Â Installing helmfile

On a mac you can install `helmfile` via:

``` 
brew install helmfile
```

Note this also installs a `helm` 3 binary on your `$PATH`


You also need to install these helm plugins:

```bash
helm plugin install https://github.com/aslafy-z/helm-git.git
helm plugin install https://github.com/databus23/helm-diff
```

### Using boot

Now run:

``` 
jx boot --helmfile
```

and follow the prompts
